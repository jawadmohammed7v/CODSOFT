## 1. Movie Genre Classification ðŸŽ¥

### **Overview**
This project aims to classify movies into genres based on their plot summaries or other textual descriptions. It demonstrates the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised learning techniques.

### **Key Features**
- Extract features using **TF-IDF** and **word embeddings**.
- Experiment with classification algorithms like **Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.
- Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### **Tools and Libraries**
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK/Spacy
- Pandas and NumPy

### **How to Run**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `movie_genre_classification` directory.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## 2. Credit Card Fraud Detection ðŸ’³

### **Overview**
This project builds a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It uses machine learning to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions based on transaction data.

### **Key Features**
- Experiment with algorithms like **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forests**.
- Handle class imbalance using techniques like **oversampling** or **undersampling**.
- Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, AUC-ROC, and confusion matrix.

### **Tools and Libraries**
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas and NumPy
- Matplotlib and Seaborn

### **How to Run**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `credit_card_fraud_detection` directory.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## 3. Customer Churn Prediction ðŸ“ˆ

### **Overview**
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a subscription-based business. The goal is to identify customers at risk of leaving based on historical data.

### **Key Features**
- Use customer data, including **demographics** and **usage behavior**, for model training.
- Experiment with algorithms like **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forests**, and **Gradient Boosting**.
- Analyze feature importance to understand key drivers of churn.

### **Tools and Libraries**
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas and NumPy
- Matplotlib and Seaborn

### **How to Run**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `customer_churn_prediction` directory.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
